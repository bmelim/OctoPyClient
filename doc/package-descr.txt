An OctoPrint client interface for small TFT touch-screen displays.

OctoPyClient can be installed on any X11 server either with or without a
window-manager. It has been designed to support small displays with at
least 480x320 resolution. The Adafruit PiTFT Plus 480x320 3.5" TFT+Touchscreen
mounted on a Raspberry Pi 3B was the target configuration. Displays with
larger resolutions such as 800x480 are compatible. Layout and size of display
objects can be modified by an alternative style sheet provided by the 
--style option.

OctoPyClient may be installed (co-located) with an OctoPrint server or may be
used remotely on a Linux Desktop within a window. Any system with the
appropriate Python3 (>=3.6) and GTK+3 support should, in all likelyhood, work
reasonalby well. Raspian Buster (Debian 10) is supported, Raspian Stretch
(Python 3.5) is not.

This application is heavily dependent on GTK/GDK and touch-screen display
interfaces. System requirements for installing and executing OctoPyClient
include proper setup of an X11 server for your choosen display hardware
and the necessary Python GTK and Cairo libraries. My recommendation is to
install distribution provided Python3 libraries for GTK and Cairo rather
than attempting to build them as a setup requirement. Getting the correct
build dependencies for installing PyGObject and pycairo with PIP is
possible, but tricky.

Installation and use information can be found in README.md in the source
package.
