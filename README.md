# OctoPyClient
An OctoPrint client interface for small TFT touch-screen modules.

OctoPyClient can be installed on any X11 server either with or without a window-manager. It has been designed for smaller displays of at least 480x320 resolution. 800x480 support is avalable as an alternative configuration.

This is a work-in-progress. It is actively being developed and it should not be used for any purpose other than reference. Expect to see frequent updates, changes to internal structure, work-flow and user interface aspects. Documentation and installation information will be added when a functional base-level is somewhat complete and stable.
